# Modeling relationships #


The NoSQL style databases has often been termed non-relational databases. This is an unfortunate misconception. As we will see, IndexedDB can easily model relationships. The real problem, however, is it does not enforce integraty of the relationships.

A relationship is essentially a reference from one object to an object. Which means, making a relationship is as simple as keeping a reference of an object in an object. The reference will be a primary key. The three kinds of relationships, one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many are modeled by storing reference. The discussion here is how to records these reference so that bi-directional transversable, efficient and consistent. Unlike RMDB system, NoSQL do not have native support for relationship. In fact, getting ride of relationship is the main objective of NoSQL so as to offer in scalability and performance. People tern to over-rely on relationship model suffering un-necessary performance penalty.

## One-to-many relationship ##

One-to-many relationship is modeled by keeping 'one' reference to objects in 'many' side. Reference is simply a primary key, which could be a string or an integer.

Refering to 'author' object store in previous session, the 'author', store has one index of named 'company'. 'author' store is related to 'company' store by defining the following store schema.
